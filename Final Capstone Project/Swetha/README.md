Experience-
I felt happy to teach what I learnt but this time I didn't teach well.But anyhow she understood howto submit projects through GitHub.I thought to improve a lot to teach .But I got second opportunity to explain but this time I didn't prepare Git concepts completely .This time Harshee madam gave choice to explain about Git what I know ,I tried to explain.I learnt to spend time in learning things irrespective of the situation.Teaching is the best way to expertise in that concept.I was curious to learn Git ,but because of not understanding two classes,it was difficult for me in understanding later classes.But after clarification of my doubts I felt I have understood those concepts. I learnt that discipline is the criteria which judge our behaviour.It doesnot mean how many times you are good,just one act of indiscipline is enough to show that you are not good.This is the biggest lesson I learnt in my last class of Git class.

Thank you Harshee madam for providing a great opportunity to learn Git concepts and you became most favourable person from SURE trust.Thank you for your support and encouragemnt till end of the course madam.
